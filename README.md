# Armstrong Number Web App

A React + Go + MySQL web application that allows users to:  
1. **Check if a number is an Armstrong number.**  
2. **View their own search history and global search history of other users.**  
3. **List all Armstrong numbers within a given range.**  

This project demonstrates a modern full-stack application using React for the frontend, Go (Golang) for the backend, and MySQL for data storage.
